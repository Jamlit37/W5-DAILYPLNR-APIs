# W5-DAILYPLNR-APIs
Here is a daily planner which goes from 9AM-5PM. Colours of grey indicator past time, green is future and red is present. Updating clock ticks over every second so the website knows what time colour to display. 

Had fun with this application and the provided CSS and HTML really helped in indicating which classes I needed to add in order to get this planner working and looking the same as the GIF provided. 

Used mostly the week's VS Code to get snippets on moment.js and Bootstrap in order to copmplete this task.
